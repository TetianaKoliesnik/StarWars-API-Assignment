Sometimes it takes a couple seconds for the content to load

### Conclusion
Somehow I managed to lose my project halfway through development, thought it was on GitHub. Luckily I had a copy on my pc and the tragedy was avoided. Lesson learned.

One can not always trust live server. I got different results when site was deployed on netlify, half of the project was not working, or styles acted differently.

API is actually fun. Styling is pain.
