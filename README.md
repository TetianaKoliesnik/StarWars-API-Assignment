Sometimes it takes a couple seconds for the content to load

### Conclusion
During development, I almost lost my project despite it being on GitHub. Fortunately, I had a local copy on my PC, so a potential disaster was avoided. Lesson learned.

One cannot always trust the live server. When the site was deployed on Netlify, I experienced different results — some parts of the project weren't working, and the styles behaved inconsistently.

Working on API is fun. Styling is pain.
